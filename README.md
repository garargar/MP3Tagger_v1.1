Edits MP3 Tags -- Version 1.1

#####How to use:

-By default, initial save location is the user's desktop (can be changed in preferences)

-Add directories containing to-be-edited MP3's using the file browser and the 'Add' button

-Directories can be removed once highlighted and by then clicking 'Remove'

-To view MP3's, update the board with 'Refresh'

-Those which contain tags will contain a checkmark and an X otherwise

-'Remove Tags' removes tags from all MP3's currently listed on the board

 which can be toggled with the checkbox
 
-The field on the bottom right indicates when a successful tag removal, copy or move operation has
 been carried out
 
######NOTE: A preferences file will be created/updated on close, the location of the file is in the same directory as the application and unfortunately cannot be changed
